Above, you see the date and time of when I probably last logged into my server.
It has been a while since I've logged in, hasn't it? This means something terrible must have happened to me.
This might be shocking news to you, but please keep reading and follow these words.

I've previously entrusted you with that special PGP private key, right? I hope you kept it well, because now's the time to use it. One of the attachments (message.gpg) is encrypted using the public key.

Oh, one more thing before you do so: If you know beforehand that I am not dead, you should keep that in mind while following the encrypted instructions.

To decrypt the file, you need to install gpg version 2. gpg version 1 might not work for this.
On some Linux distros, you might have to replace `gpg` with `gpg2` below.

gpg --import <the key file I gave you>
gpg --decrypt message.gpg
